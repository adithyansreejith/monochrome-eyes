## About ##
Contains a very simple dark sddm greeter config files. Clock is disabled by default because it clashed with my minimal rice. Can be enabled if you want. 
By default there is no message for a wrong password input. Buttons have only icons and are not named. Has option to change the Desktop Environment of your session.
## Installation ##
SDDM themes are typically located in the `/usr/share/sddm/themes/` directory. Copy the files into a folder in that location.
### Issues ###
>Virtual keyboard is disabled forcefully. For use in touchscreens has to re-enable them. Had to do so because of a bug in my system
