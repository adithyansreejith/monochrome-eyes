## About ##
Contains a very simple dark sddm greeter config files. Clock is disabled by default because it clashed with my minimal rice. Can be enabled if you want. 
By default there is no message for a wrong password input. Buttons have only icons and are not named. Has option to change the Desktop Environment of your session.
### Issues ###
>Virtual keyboard is disabled forcefully. For use in touchscreens has to re-enable them. Had to do so because of a bug in my system
